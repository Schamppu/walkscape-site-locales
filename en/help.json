        "answer": "WalkScape is an RPG game inspired by RuneScape and other MMORPGs. However, it has one glaring difference: you don't play it actively. Instead, you gain progress by walking in real life. The game has a massive open-world map with over a hundred locations for the player to explore. The world is filled with lore, NPCs, quests, and activities for the player to engage in, and more! Our goal with the game is to encourage an active lifestyle and promote both mental and physical health."
